A simple microservice that demonstrates using a rout variable to to call
an API which returns both a natural language date (ex. January 2, 2016) and
a unix timestamp for that date.

This is the first back-end API project for the FreeCodeCamp Back-end Workshop.

Once cloned or downloaded, issue an "npm install" command to generate ll dependencies required.
Once dependencies have been installed, run "npm start" ( or node server.js ) to start the server. 
Then go to "localhost:3000" to begin.

In addition to the bootstrap css library, MomentJS is used to perform date validation and conversion.
